But it was trained only on a cpu (since we used only numpy package and did not do any cuda coding ) and we trained it only for 25 epochs (~ 30 mins in a laptop 4 core i5 cpu ). We can improve the performance by, making the network bigger, training it for longer etc. But if we want to improve our model a lot, what we can do is use a CNN instead of a vanilla RNN!\n",
